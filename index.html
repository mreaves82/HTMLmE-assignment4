            I liked bicycles from an early age. The picture above is from when i
            was 8 years old. In 7th grade, for career day, I worked in a local
            bicycle shop.

            >In high school and into me early adult years I forgot about
            bicycles. After high school, I bought a car moved out on my own and
            got a place in the city. I was living in the heart of Midtown
            Atlanta in my early 20's when my car broke down and was not worth
            fixing. I decided not to not buy another car and start taking the
            bus to cut down on expenses. Taking the bus was not a fun. The worst
            part about it was the time investment. You could end up spending 3
            or 4 hours of your time traveling.
          </span>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing the bus thing for some
            time, I came across a bicycle that was next to a dumpster; obviously
            thrown away by someone. It was an old huffy racing bike with sexy
            drop handlebars. It was a total piece of shit(every that huffy makes
            is). Despite that, due to the thinner rims and geometry of the
            frame, it was faster and more responsive than any bike I had been on
            previously. I fell in love with racing bikes that day. Soon after, I
            ditched the huffy and got a vintage Schwinn racing bike, and then
            got more vintage bikes and cleaned them up and fixed them. The bus
            was no more, I rode where I had to go. Not only did I fall in love
            with road bikes but I fell in love with bicycle commuting in urban
            settings.

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2010 I moved back to the suburbs
            of Atlanta, and still without a car, I was suddenly finding
            bicycling an inadequate form of transportation. I considered still
            getting a car, but after some thought I decided to two stay true to
            two-wheeled transportation and learn how to ride a motorcycle, and
            buy one. I settled on a 1998 Suzuki Savage, with 600 miles on it. I
            got it for $1000 dollars!!!! Over the next two years I put about
            15,000 miles on it. During that time, I wrecked one time while was
            going too fast around a curve. I went off the road, fell off the
            bike, and broke my wrist. It was the first and only time I broke a
            bone, and it was some of the worst pain I'd felt in my life.

            I ended up selling my motorcycle and moving back to the city. For
            years I had been working in the service industry, and it was getting
            old, it had been old. Out of curiosity I looked online one day and
            found an ad for a bicycle shop hiring. I applied, was called in for
            an interview, and began work a week and a half later. Within three
            months I was the operations manager. My childhood dream of working
            at a bicycle shop was finally realized. I learned a lot at that job,
            about bicycles and about management and retail. It was stressful. I
            had a lot of responsibility. Overall it was a great experience in my
            life.

          <p>
            While working at performance bicycle I was doing the bicycle
            commuting thing again. Every morning I rode 8 miles to work during
            rush hour. One day, on my way to work, I suddenly woke up in the
            back of an ambulance, not really sure how I got there. I was rear
            ended by a car, witnesses said it was a bad accident. Despite the
            seriousness of the accident, I managed to walk out of the emergency
            room 4 hours after arrival. I got a lawyer that week who specialized
            in bicycle accidents, and six months later received pretty nice
            settlement. I used that money to finance my move from Atlanta to
            Clearwater, where I live today.

            The best thing about Florida, besides the beaches, is that it's a
            great place to ride both motorcycles and bicycles. I'm considering
            finally getting a car again, but even if I do, my heart will be on
            two wheels till the day I die.
